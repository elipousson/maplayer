The goal of maplayer is to provide a consistent set of functions for creating map layers using simple feature ({sf}) data, the {ggplot2} package, and a variety of ggplot2 extension packages.

## Basic functions

The main layers that work with both a data and location sf object are:

-   `layer_location_data()`
-   `layer_location()`
-   `layer_location_context()`

There are several layers that can work with a single sf object as the input data:

-   `layer_markers()`
-   `layer_numbers()`
-   `layer_frame()`
-   `layer_scaled()`
-   `layer_mask()`
-   `layer_neatline()`

Finally, there are layers that require additional packages (listed in Suggests) or an API key (for `layer_mapbox`):

-   `layer_labelled()` optionally uses [ggrepel](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/) or [geomtextpath](https://allancameron.github.io/geomtextpath/)
-   `layer_mapbox()` uses [mapboxapi](https://walker-data.com/mapboxapi/)
-   `layer_marked()` uses [ggforce](https://ggforce.data-imaginist.com/)
-   `layer_icon()` uses [ggsvg](https://coolbutuseless.github.io/package/ggsvg/)

The package also allows the optional use of packages designed for transforming spatial data or modifying ggplot2 maps. These include:

-   [smoothr](https://strimas.com/smoothr/) (required to use the smooth parameter)
-   [ggfx](https://ggfx.data-imaginist.com/) (required to use the drop_shadow parameter)

Many of the functions in {maplayer} were originally developed for the {overedge} package or before that for the {mapbaltimore} package. The {overedge} package has been split up into three smaller packages including {maplayer}, [{getdata}](https://elipousson.github.io/getdata/), and [{sfext}](https://elipousson.github.io/sfext/).

## Installation

You can install the development version of maplayer like so:

``` r
pak::pkg_install("elipousson/maplayer")
```

## Example

```{r setup}
library(maplayer)
library(ggplot2)
library(sf)
```

### Make icon maps with sf objects and ggplot2

`layer_icon()` wraps `ggsvg::geom_point_svg()` to provide an convenient way to make icon maps.

You can create maps using a single named icon that matches one of the icons in `map_icons`.

```{r}
nc <- st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf"))
nc <- st_transform(nc, 3857)
theme_set(theme_void())

nc_map <-
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = nc)

nc_map +
  layer_icon(data = nc, icon = "point-start", size = 8)
```
